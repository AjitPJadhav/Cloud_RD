This project intend to evovle the spaceshared VM allocation policy of the cloudbroker and thereby improving scheduling efficiency using a probabilistic approach which uses a modified ant colony optimization technique. Hypercubic peer to peer cloud topology is being realised using brite file by Boston University. 

Build 1.0

*Static single topology
*Dynamised algorithm for Datasets
*Efficient CIS handling
*Proven algorithm comparison
*Optimized runtime efficiency
*Space shared peer to peer approach
